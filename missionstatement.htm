            <p> The Penn Consortium of Undergraduate Women seeks to enact the systemic change necessary for the unbridled self-actualization of Penn's female students, faculty, and staff. We will always do our part to establish the institutional infrastructure within which women are empowered to reach their potential. We will take gender equity seriously, and will welcome the day that women ascend their own personal and professional ladders free of self-doubt and full of self-esteem.
            </p>

        <br> <i> Why PCUW? </i> 
        <br>  I got involved with the Penn Consortium of Undergraduate Women (PCUW) for several reasons, but there are two that are prominent in my mind. One: because I feel passionate about creating a space for open discussion/planning of events which aim to make the gender inequalities more salient (especially to those who may think we live in a completely egalitarian society which doesn't need change) and actively try to advance the interests of women. Two: I wanted to meet open-minded people on this campus who were also interested in feminism.

        </br> <i> Three words to describe me </i>
        <br> silly, open-minded, curious
        </br>

        </br> <i> Favorite author </i>
        <br> Tie between Gabriel Garcia Marquez and Fyodor Dostoyevsky! 
        </br>

        </br> <i> Patronus </i>
        <br> I am 100% sure my Patronus would be a cat. 
        </br>

        </br> <i> Talk to me about... </i>
        <br> Oh, so many things! I love art, movies, books, poetry, and especially music. The Barnes Foundation and the Philadelphia Museum of Art are two of my favorite places in this city. I love movies and am especially fond of Quentin Tarantino's works! I am a huge Beatles fan and listen to lots of music from the '60s like Bob Dylan, the Doors, the Zombies, the Shirelles, but I also enjoy classical music immensely. I love to read and find that I am particularly moved by the writings of Ezra Pound and Gabriel Garcia Marquez (as mentioned above).
